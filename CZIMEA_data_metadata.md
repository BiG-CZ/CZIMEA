# Listing and links to CZIMEA data and metadata
4/5/2019

- [Cross-CZO sample processing workflow diagram (pdf)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9NLnOiN5c1RUXIzbGNYVTNWMG8)
- Data "types" generated are described elsewhere. That information should be added here
- [Mayorga et al, Cross-Site Soil and Microbial Ecology Cyberinfrastructure for the CZIMEA EarthCube Project (pdf).](https://github.com/BiG-CZ/CZIMEA/blob/master/EMayorga_ECAHM2017_Poster.pdf) Poster presented at the [CUAHSI Conference on Hydroinformatics in Tuscaloosa, AL, July 2017.](https://www.cuahsi.org/community/cuahsi-science-meetings/)
- Also relevant: data collected by the CZO's at the same sites

## Sampling planning and geospatial data
- MODIS-derived mean annual time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to identify the timing of peak greenness
- Environmental characterization for the site, based on spatial datasets (for now, see [these notes](#4) about this effort. These will be loaded into the CZIMEA ODM2 Admin system listed below

## Environmental data and site/stample metadata
- CZIMEA ODM2 Admin
  - Development version, https://dev-odm2admin.cuahsi.org/CZIMEA/ (User permission required)
  - Live version (coming)
- Sample metadata (SESAR & IGSN). Examples
  - Southern Sierra CZO: San Joaquin Experimental Reserve (SJER) Core, https://data.geosamples.org/sample/igsn/IERRR00AS
  - https://data.geosamples.org/sample/igsn/IERRR00GV
- Sampling and analytical methods. Some are available as documents online. A better approach could be explored using systems like https://www.protocols.io

## Omics data
- MG-RAST CZIMEA data: http://www.mg-rast.org/mgmain.html?mgpage=search&search=mgp80869 ("merged, quality filtered, and unassembled shotgun sequences are available")
- Other data deposited as described in a CZIMEA manuscript being submitted for publication
