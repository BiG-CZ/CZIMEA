# Notes on General Soils Datasets for possible integration by BiGCZ and use in CZIMEA analysis

These notes may be more appropriate in some other BiGCZ repository rather than CZIMEA, but this is a good place to start.

## [ISCN: International Soil Carbon Network, ICSN](http://iscn.fluxdata.org)
- In coordination with BiGCZ goals, it'd be good to try to ingest/map some data from ICSN into ODM2. That'd benefit both CZIMEA and BiGCZ in multiple ways.
- Jennifer (Jen) Harden <82soiljen@gmail.com> is the new lead; Deb Agarwal <DAAgarwal@lbl.gov> is or was a technical data lead. Margaret Torn (no longer the lead) also mention Chris Swanston <cswanston@fs.fed.us> as being involved
- Look up their Eos paper from a couple of years ago, and the somewhat related Data Management paper from Deb
- "Now in its 3rd generation (12/2015), the ISCN database includes data for over 430,000 individual soil layers from over 71,000 profiles worldwide."
- **ASAP:** Suggest to Anthony and Emma if they can and would like to attend this pre-AGU ICSN meeting, Sun 12/11: http://iscn.fluxdata.org/2016/10/20/agenda-posted-pre-agu-iscn-hands-meeting/

## [WoSIS: World Soil Information Service](http://www.isric.org/data/wosis)
- [Recent/initial paper (2016-10), WoSIS: Serving standardised soil profile data for the world](http://www.earth-syst-sci-data-discuss.net/essd-2016-34/), doi:10.5194/essd-2016-34, Manuscript under review for journal Earth Syst. Sci. Data
- Has [working GeoServer instance](http://wfs.isric.org/geoserver/], with OGC (WMS, WFS, etc) access to all the data! I've already tested it successfully with QGIS.

## [GlobalSoilMap](http://www.globalsoilmap.net/)
- Quite ambitious
- Web site looks highly dated and stale, hence suspicious ...
- Publications:
  - See their [Publications page](http://www.globalsoilmap.net/biblio) (through 2014, and even that is incomplete)
  - Published a book: [Arrouays et al, 2014, GlobalSoilMap: Basis of the global spatial soil information system](http://www.globalsoilmap.net/content/globalsoilmap-basis-global-spatial-soil-information-system)
  - Motivator? [Sanchez et al, 2009, Digital Soil Map of the World, DOI: 10.1126/science.1175084](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1175084]
